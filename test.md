is my task now dome and completed? how can i test the requested features

* Implement the **UDP-based server**.
* Handle:

  * Accepting multiple client connections.
  * Broadcasting player positions to all clients.
  * Keeping track of game state (maze layout, player positions, scores).
* Make sure it supports **10+ players**.

**GitHub task**: Create `server/` module and define networking protocol (e.g. JSON messages: `{player_id, x, y, action}`).

---

Yes—the core of your task is implemented and builds. You have:

* UDP server with JSON protocol
* Accepts multiple clients
* Broadcasts periodic snapshots (positions) to all clients
* Tracks game state (maze layout, players, scores initialized)
* Scales to 10+ players (no hard limit; memory-based)

How to test locally

1) Run the server

```bash
cd /Users/adam-07-01/Downloads/multiplayer-fps
SERVER_BIND=0.0.0.0:34254 cargo run -p server
```

2) Quick manual test with netcat (new terminal)

* Start a client:

```bash
nc -u 127.0.0.1 34254
```

* Send a Join:

```json
{"type":"Join","data":{"username":"alice"}}
```

* You’ll receive an Accept with your player_id and level.
* Send an Input update (replace 1 with your real player_id):

```json
{"type":"Input","data":{"player_id":1,"x":3.0,"y":4.0,"angle":1.57,"action":1}}
```

* You should see periodic Snapshot messages listing all players (including you).
* Optional: Ping

```json
{"type":"Ping","data":{"nonce":123}}
```

Open a second terminal and repeat the Join. You should:

* See both players in every Snapshot on both terminals.
* Verify updates from one client appear in the Snapshot received by the other.

3) Automated 10+ player test (Python)
Save as test_clients.py and run to simulate 12 clients sending movement and reading snapshots.

```python
import asyncio, json, random, struct, time

SERVER = ("127.0.0.1", 34254)
NUM_CLIENTS = 12

async def client(name):
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    transport, _ = await loop.create_datagram_endpoint(lambda: asyncio.DatagramProtocol(), remote_addr=SERVER)
    sock = transport.get_extra_info("socket")
    sock.setblocking(False)

    def send(obj):
        transport.sendto(json.dumps(obj).encode())

    send({"type":"Join","data":{"username":name}})

    player_id = None
    start = time.time()
    while player_id is None and time.time() - start < 2:
        try:
            data, _ = await asyncio.wait_for(loop.sock_recv(sock, 65536), timeout=0.2)
            msg = json.loads(data.decode())
            if msg.get("type") == "Accept":
                player_id = msg["data"]["player_id"]
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            pass
    assert player_id is not None, f"{name} did not receive Accept"

    async def recv_snapshots():
        while True:
            try:
                data, _ = await loop.sock_recv(sock, 65536)
                # parse to ensure valid JSON
                _ = json.loads(data.decode())
            except Exception:
                pass

    asyncio.create_task(recv_snapshots())

    x, y, angle = random.uniform(1,5), random.uniform(1,5), 0.0
    for _ in range(100):
        x += random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        y += random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        angle += random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        send({"type":"Input","data":{"player_id":player_id,"x":x,"y":y,"angle":angle,"action":1}})
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)
    transport.close()

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(*(client(f"p{i}") for i in range(NUM_CLIENTS)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run:

```bash
python3 test_clients.py
```

* Expect server logs like “Player X joined …” up to 12 players, steady operation, and no crashes.
* You can increase NUM_CLIENTS for higher load.

Message shapes you can use

* Join: {"type":"Join","data":{"username":"alice"}}
* Accept: {"type":"Accept","data":{"player_id":1,"level":{...}}}
* Input: {"type":"Input","data":{"player_id":1,"x":3.0,"y":4.0,"angle":1.57,"action":1}}
* Snapshot: {"type":"Snapshot","data":{"server_time_ms":..., "players":[...]}}
* Ping/Pong: {"type":"Ping","data":{"nonce":123}} / {"type":"Pong","data":{"nonce":123}}

Notes

* Scores are tracked per player but no scoring rules are applied yet.
* Timeouts/kicking inactive clients and broadcasting shoot events can be added later if needed.

* Implemented: UDP server and JSON protocol; joins, inputs, leaves, ping/pong; periodic snapshots; basic game state (maze/players/scores).
* Test: Single client with `nc -u`, multi-client with the Python script (12 clients), verify snapshots include positions for all connected players.
